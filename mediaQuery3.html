                The people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100
                BC.[a][6] This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul.[6] The Romans believed these
                war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat
                located further north.[6] The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and
                Visigoths as having come from Gotland.[6] The northern menace survived the fall of the Western Roman
                Empire.

                The Frankish Empire that succeeded them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat.[6] As
                the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish
                people. This is when the Vikings first entered into written history.[6] The first recorded raid in the
                west was at Lindisfarne in 793.[7] Why the Vikings suddenly began raiding is not completely clear. But a
                popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone.[8]
                The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia.
