                The people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100
                BC.[a][6] This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul.[6] The Romans believed these
                war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat
                located further north.[6] The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and
                Visigoths as having come from Gotland.[6] The northern menace survived the fall of the Western Roman
                Empire.

                The Frankish Empire that succeeded them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat.[6] As
                the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish
                people. This is when the Vikings first entered into written history.[6] The first recorded raid in the
                west was at Lindisfarne in 793.[7] Why the Vikings suddenly began raiding is not completely clear. But a
                popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone.[8]
                The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia. They turned to looting, then
                returning home. These hit and run raids were made possible because the Vikings were master boat builders
                and they created flat bottomed boats ideal for journeys up rivers, where many monastic sites lay, ready
                for plundering. [9] This seems to indicate there was space enough for everyone.[8] Because they found
                raiding so easy, it became more and more popular among the Vikings.[8]

                Three different groups of Vikings can be identified. They took three different, sometimes overlapping,
                routes.[8]
